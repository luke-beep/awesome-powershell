A handpicked collection of impressive [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) packages and resources. Including customized modules, scripts, and snippets.

PowerShell is a versatile tool that operates across various platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS). It's primarily designed for automation and configuration tasks, excelling in handling structured data formats (like JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), interacting with REST APIs, and manipulating object models. It comes with a command-line shell and a scripting language. The language syntax is similar to Perl and Python, but it's built on top of the .NET Framework, which makes it more powerful and flexible.
